A graphical input tool for the edX platform.


Installation
------------
Clone this repository, then `npm install`. You'll need to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and npm (which is now packaged with Node) installed on your system.


Tests
-----
`npm test`

Note that the test runner ([Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io)) will try to start Google Chrome to run the tests. To use a different browser, edit `karma.conf.js`.


Deploying
---------

[TODO] The project will eventually include a way to bundle and minify all the scripts, minify the CSS, etc.
